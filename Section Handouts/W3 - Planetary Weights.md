Prompts the user for a weight on Earth
and a planet (in separate inputs). Then 
prints the equivalent weight on that planet.

Note that the user should type in a planet with 
the first letter as uppercase, and you do not need
to handle the case where a user types in something 
other than one of the planets (that is not Earth).
